## Description
You may have heard of Instagram, maybe Facebook, or maybe you've heard of Twitter before Elon invested his pocket change into making it X.  But what you don't know is, he only invested his pocket change into Twitter because he saw bigger and better things...

Quale. A social network for you, your mum and your 3 cats.  By the end of the week I hope you think about moving your entire life to Quale, where I promise I won't be harvesting your data and selling it to your internet overlords ;)

Fun Fact! Qual e` means 'what's up?' in Brazilian Portuguese!

## Developer Comments
This is project 3, the final project of the edX/Monash University bootcamp.  When I started this assignment I didn't feel too confident with React, but through doing this project, it was a great exercise to better understand React concepts.  As an update to this project in future I want to add context and reducers, and use it to replace the props that control the modal component that I use to lift state up throughout my app.  Towards the end of the 2 week deadline, I didn't get enough time to fix all the little bugs and make it look as pretty as I wanted, but I'm really proud of the functionality that I was able to implement, and how fluent I got with writing GraphQL and React in a short period of time.  An issue I had with sending emails through Outlook was Authentication... if I sent to many emails in a short period of time, it would flag it as a security issue and send an error back to the server.  Unfortunately, I have not found a way around this with Outlook, but in future I would look at using a different service, or using a different Authentication method.

I want to spend more time in perfecting this project a little more after the due date, so in the 'Issues' tab of this repo you will see future improvements and bug fixes of known issues.

The project requirements of this project were as follows:

```md
Use React for the front end.
Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
Have a polished UI.
Be responsive.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Include authentication (JWT).
Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).
Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
